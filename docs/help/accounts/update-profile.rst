Update your profile
===================

Your profile on the LNL Database (LNLDB) contains a variety of information about you, most of which you can edit.


Accessing your profile
----------------------

To access your profile, log into the LNLDB at `lnl.wpi.edu/db <https://lnl.wpi.edu>`_. Once logged in, you will see
`Logged in as <Your Name>` in the top right corner of the page. Clicking on ``<Your Name>`` will take you to your
profile. Your profile has information like what events you have participated in, how many meetings you have attended,
and how many hours you have spent on events, as well as your contact information and your training certificates.


Editing your profile
--------------------

Click the blue `Modify` button to edit your profile. Here you can update user, contact and student info. Contact the
Secretary at `lnl-s@wpi.edu <mailto:lnl-s@wpi.edu>`_ if you need to make changes to the non-editable fields. When you
have completed your updates, click the blue `Update Member and Return` button at the bottom of the page to save your
changes.


.. note::
    Internal info can only be edited by those with Officer level access. Please reach out to our Secretary if this
    information is incorrect.
