Updating Membership Roles (Officers)
====================================

User roles (sometimes referred to as "groups") determine what content specific users on the LNLDB can access. Examples
of the various groups include officers, alumni, active members, associate members, and more.

Changing a User's Role(s)
-------------------------

.. caution::
    **Permission Required:** Change group membership of a user

    In order to change user roles, you must have been assigned a role that gives you permission to change user group
    memberships. If the `Groups` field is not visible or is disabled, your current role(s) do not grant you adequate
    permission to change this setting.

To update a memberâ€™s roles, navigate to their profile in the LNLDB. The easiest way to do this is by navigating to
`Members` > `All Members` and selecting the user you would like to edit. Click the blue `Modify` button and scroll down
to the `Internal Info` section. In the `Groups` field, find and select each group you wish to make the user a member of.
Check to make sure each of the desired groups is highlighted, then save your modifications by clicking the `Update
Member and Return` button at the bottom of the page.

.. note::
    Associating a new user will automatically trigger a welcome email
