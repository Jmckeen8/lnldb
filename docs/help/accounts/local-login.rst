================================
Set a password for non-SSO login
================================

The recommended way to log into the LNL Database (LNLDB) is to use your WPI Microsoft account. However, you may also
want to set a local password for those rare instances when Microsoft’s services are unavailable or if you find this
method more convenient. There are two ways to enable this sign-in method: on your own or by contacting our Webmaster.


Set the password yourself
-------------------------

To set the password yourself, log into the LNLDB (using your WPI Microsoft account) then click on your name in the top
right corner of the page. Next click the blue `Modify` button, then under the `User Info` section you should see a link
to `Set a password for non-SSO login`. Click that link then enter your desired password. Passwords must be at least 8
characters long and contain at least one of each of the following:

- a capital letter
- a number
- a non-alphanumeric character or symbol

Having trouble?
---------------

If you’ve been locked out of your account or otherwise can’t sign in, contact the `Webmaster <mailto:lnl-w@wpi.edu>`_
and they should be able to get you squared away.
