Report Bugs
===========

Oh no! If you're here then that likely means...

Well, as hard as we try to keep things running smoothly, the fact of the matter is, you cannot win them all. If you've
encountered a bug while using the LNL Database, please let us know. Our Webmaster does get notified each time there is a
server error, but it often helps to have a bit more context, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

You can submit a bug report by doing any of the following:

#. `Submit a new issue on GitHub <https://github.com/WPI-LNL/lnldb>`_
#. Email tfed-db@wpi.edu

In your message, be sure to tell us where you were on the site, what you were doing, and what went wrong. The more
details you can provide, the better.
