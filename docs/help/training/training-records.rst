Manage Member Training Records
==============================

Here at LNL, safety is our top priority. Due to the nature of our work and the equipment we use, we require that our
members undergo training before carrying out certain activities. This includes, but is not limited to: rigging truss,
operating aerial work platforms / lifts, and working with three-phase electrical power. To help us ensure that our
members are properly trained, the LNLDB maintains records of all member training and certifications.

    For more information about our training policies and procedures or to learn more about upcoming training sessions,
    contact our `Technical Director <mailto:lnl-td@wpi.edu>`_.

View Training Records
---------------------

.. caution::
    If you do not see `Members` > `Training` in the navigation bar, then you do not have permission to access member
    training records. Typically, you will need to be an active or alumni member.

There are actually a few different places in the LNLDB where you will find training records. The first is the training
dashboard. To get to the training dashboard select `Members` > `Training` from the navigation bar.

You can also view training records for specific individuals on the member's profile page. Training records typically
include the type of training, the date the training was performed, who issued the training, and when it expires.

Update Training Records
-----------------------

.. caution::
    **Permission Required:** Add training

    In order to update training records, you must have been assigned a role that allows you to add training records to
    the database. If you do not see the big blue `Enter Training` button on the training dashboard, your current role(s)
    do not grant you adequate permissions to do any of the following.


Enter New Training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Start by selecting `Members` > `Training` from the navigation bar.
#. Click the big blue `Enter Training` button.
#. Under `Training type`, select the type of training that was performed.
#. Enter the date on which the training session was held. You may use the built-in calendar widget or enter the date
   manually in ``mm/dd/yyyy`` format.
#. If the training session was conducted by an LNL member, enter their name into the `Trainer` field. As you type, the
   field will automatically search the database for users that match your query. Select the correct user from the
   results to continue. For trainings conducted by an external organization you may leave this field blank.
#. Under `Trainees`, enter the names of each individual person who attended the training session. As you type, the field
   will automatically search the database for users that match your query. Select the correct user from the results then
   repeat until all the trainees are listed.
#. If the training has an expiration date, be sure to enter that date into the `Expiration date` field. You may use the
   built-in calendar widget or enter the date manually in ``mm/dd/yyyy`` format.
#. Finally, if you wish to include any notes about the training, enter them in the `Notes` field. When everything
   looks good, click `Save`.

.. note::
   If the type of training you wish to record is not listed in the dropdown, contact our
   `Webmaster <mailto:lnl-w@wpi.edu>`_.

.. note::
    Typically, the person running the training session must already have a valid training record before they can issue
    training to others.


Add Notes
^^^^^^^^^

You may update training notes at any time using the cards displayed on the user's profile page.

#. Navigate to the user's profile page.
#. Under `Trainings`, locate the card for the respective training.
#. Click `Edit notes`, then update the notes as needed.
#. Click `Save`


Revoke Training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes it may be necessary to revoke someone's training if they fail to adhere to established safety procedures. To
revoke a training:

#. Navigate to the user's profile page.
#. Under `Trainings`, locate the card for the respective training.
#. Click `Revoke`

.. danger::
    Once training has been revoked, the action cannot be undone. The training will need to be reentered once the user
    has been retrained.
