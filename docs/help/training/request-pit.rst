Request a PIT
=============

In order to safely and correctly operate LNLâ€™s projection equipment, we offer our members various levels of training,
called PITs (Projectionists in Training). PITs are leveled one through six and must be completed in order. Upon
completion of all six PITs, a member may take a written test and a practical to complete their training. Each PIT gives
you access to operate more of the equipment in the booth while running a projection event.


Requesting a PIT
----------------

#. In the navigation bar select `Projection` > `Request Training`.
#. Select the type of training you would like to schedule from the `PIT` dropdown.
#. Optionally, you may request a specific date and time in the `Request Date / Time` field.

   - Dates can be selected by entering the date in ``yyyy-mm-dd`` format in the first field or by selecting a date from
     the calendar widget.
   - Times can be selected by entering a date in ``hh:mm a`` format in the second field or by selecting a time from the
     time widget.

#. After selecting the type of training and optionally a date and time, click `Submit Request`.

The Head Projectionist will be notified of your request and will reach out to confirm a date and time.

.. hint::
    If you have not completed any PITs and you are unsure of which level of training you should request, select PIT 1.
