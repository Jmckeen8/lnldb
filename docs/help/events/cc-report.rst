Writing a Crew Chief Report
===========================

Crew chief reports (CC reports) are important records for future crew chiefs of similar events. These reports should be
written not long after the event ends by each of the crew chiefs. This guide will explain where and how to write one.

.. tip::
    **Officers:** Need to remind someone to complete their CC report? Use the `Remind All` button under the `Reports`
    tab on the event detail page.


Where to Write the Report
-------------------------

Reports are stored alongside events in the LNL Database (LNLDB), which can be accessed at
`lnl.wpi.edu/db <https://lnl.wpi.edu>`_. The easiest way to access the events you have been a crew chief for is by
selecting `Events` > `My Events` from the navigation bar, which should take you to a list with a section titled
`Events as Crew Chief`. From here you can select the blue `CC Report` button in the right column to write your report.

You can also get to it from the event detail page under the `Reports` tab. Click the `New` button to add a report.

.. important::
    You will only have 14 days after the event to write your report so please be prompt and do not put it off!


What to Include in the Report
-----------------------------

On the report page there are some questions to answer and two boxes. The left box is where you type your report,
answering the listed questions. The right box will show a preview of the report, with formatting applied. When you have
completed your report, click the `Save Changes` button and you are done!
