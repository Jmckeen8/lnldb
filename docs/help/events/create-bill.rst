====================================
Generate and Send a Bill (Treasurer)
====================================

The LNLDB allows you to easily create an invoice for an event based on the event information in our database and
automatically generates an email to send to the client for gathering their Workday worktag details.


Generate an Invoice
-------------------

You can generate an invoice or quote for an event at any time on the event detail page. Select the `Billing` tab, then
under `Bills` click the blue `Download Invoice` or `Download Quote` button.

Billing a Client
----------------

.. caution::
    **Permission Required:** Bill event

    In order to create or update bills for an event, you must have been assigned a role that gives you permission to do
    so. If you do not see the `Create Bill` button, your current role(s) may not grant you adequate permission.


Create and Send a Bill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    The event must have already been reviewed before it can be billed. If the event status is `Awaiting Review`, please
    contact the officer responsible for reviewing the event before continuing.

#. Click `Create Bill` on the event page. This button will only appear once the event has been reviewed.
#. Enter the date billed and the total amount due. These fields will be pre-filled with the current date and the total
   amount from the `Price Breakdown` in the billing tab. Be sure to double check these values and update them if
   necessary.
#. Next you will have the option to generate and send an email to the client to request their Workday worktag. If you
   do not wish to send an email at this time, click `Save and Return`. Otherwise click `Save and Make Email`.
#. If you chose to send the email, the next page will automatically generate an email for you and give you the
   opportunity to edit the message and subject line. The `User Recipients` field allows you to define specific users to
   send the email to, while the `Client Recipients` field lists any applicable exec board email aliases. Once you're
   satisfied with the setup, click `Send Email`. The bill will be added to the email automatically as an attachment.


Updating a Bill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To update the details of a bill, click the `Update` button next to the bill you wish to edit. Update the date billed
and/or the amount then hit `Save Changes`. Clicking `Reset Form` will reset the `Date billed` and `Amount` fields.


Mark a Bill as Paid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few different ways to mark a bill as paid. One of the easiest methods is to update the bill from the event
detail page. Under the `Billing` tab, locate the bill then click the `Mark Paid` button. This button will also appear
in a few additional places throughout the LNLDB, such as on the `All Events` page (`Events` > `All Events`).
