======================
Create / Edit an Event
======================

The event editor is a way for LNL members to create events in the LNLDB. It offers a more advanced and comprehensive
approach when compared to the workorder wizard with additional options for specifying internal details.

-----

Using the Event Editor
----------------------

To access the event editor, start from the `LNLDB <https://lnl.wpi.edu/db/>`_, then select `Events` > `Add Event` from
the navigation bar.

#. **Name and Location:** All the basic information for the event goes here. This includes the event name, location, and
   description. Check the help text below each field for additional information and clarification on what each option
   does.
#. **Contact:** This is where you’ll select the person who will serve as the event contact and the organization that
   will act as the client. Simply start by typing the name of the user or organization you wish to add into the
   respective field. As you type, the field will automatically search our database for a match. Once the user or
   organization appears in the search results, select it from the list. If the client you’re doing the event for is
   different than the client you’re billing, then note that the `Client(s)` and `Client to bill` fields may differ.
#. **Scheduling:** This tab is where you will specify all the scheduling details for the event (i.e. start time, end
   time, etc.).
#. **Services:** This is where you select which services LNL is providing for the event.

.. tip::
    If you need to add more than 3 services to an event, start by filling out the first three form fields then click
    the `Save Changes` button at the bottom of the page. You’ll then be brought to the event page. Once you’re there,
    click `Edit` to go back and add the additional services.

-----

Add Extras
----------

.. caution::
    **Permission Required:** Adjust event charges (Officers and Crew Chiefs)

    In order to add extras or OneOff charges to an event, you must have been assigned a role that gives you permission
    to adjust event charges. By default, only Officers and the event Crew Chiefs will have this permission.


If you need to add extras to an event, such as a mirror ball, navigate to the event page, switch to the `Services` tab,
and click the blue `Modify Extras` button on the right side.

.. note::
    You can only add 1 at a time, so if you need to add multiple extra items, save your changes, then click
    `Modify Extras` again.

-----

Add OneOff Charges
------------------

.. caution::
    **Permission Required:** Adjust event charges (Officers and Crew Chiefs)

    In order to add extras or OneOff charges to an event, you must have been assigned a role that gives you permission
    to adjust event charges. By default, only Officers and the event Crew Chiefs will have this permission.

These are usually very specific or custom charges that need to be added to a client's bill. To add one of these charges,
navigate to the `Billing` tab, then click the `Add OneOff Charges` button.
