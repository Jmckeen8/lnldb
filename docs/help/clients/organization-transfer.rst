=====================================
Transfer Ownership of an Organization
=====================================

Only the owner of an organization will have the ability to update the organization's contact information and associated
users. Therefore, when there is a change in who is primarily responsible for your organization, such as during a
transition between exec boards, it is highly recommended that you transfer control of your organization over to this new
individual. Who you choose to be primarily responsible for your organization is up to you.


Submit a Transfer Request
-------------------------

#. Log into the `LNLDB <https://lnl.wpi.edu/db>`_ then select `Clients` > `My Organizations` from the navigation bar.
#. In the table that appears, select your organization. Once you are on your organization's profile page, click the
   green `Transfer` button to start a transfer request.
#. Next, select the user you would like to transfer ownership of the organization to. This user must already be
   associated with the organization. Anyone who has submitted an event on behalf of the organization will have been
   added to this list automatically. If you need to edit the list of associated users for your organization (and you
   are the organization's current owner), go back to the profile page then click the blue `Edit` button. Under
   `Associated Users` begin typing the name of the person you would like to add, then select the corresponding entry
   from the drop down menu as it appears. Click `Save Changes` then return to your transfer request.
#. Once you've selected a user, click `Submit Transfer`. Both the current owner and the new owner should now receive an
   email with a link to complete the transfer. Click that link. Note that only one of you will need to do this in order
   to approve the transfer request.
#. Once you've clicked the link you should be all set! The new owner will now have full edit access to the organization
   profile.

.. note::
    Keep in mind that `any` user associated with your organization can submit a transfer request. This ensures that you
    can still transfer ownership of the organization even if the current owner cannot be contacted or is no longer able
    to access the LNLDB.

.. caution::
    If you receive an unauthorized transfer request, please contact our `Webmaster <mailto:lnl-w@wpi.edu>`_.
