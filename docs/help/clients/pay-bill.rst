====================
How to Pay Your Bill
====================

Once your event has ended, our Treasurer will be in touch to send you the bill. If you are acting on behalf of a WPI
club, organization, or department, you will have the option to submit payments through Workday. This is the recommended
approach, however you may also pay via cash or check. LNL does not accept credit cards.

Pay via Workday
---------------

You should have received an email from us with your most recent invoice. Look for the big yellow `Pay Now` button and
click it to submit your Workday account information.

You'll need to sign in if you haven't already. Then, on the page that appears, review the event details and the cost
breakdown. If anything on this page seems incorrect, stop what you are doing and
`contact our Treasurer <mailto:lnl-t@wpi.edu>`_.

If everything looks good, select your funding source and enter your worktag. Your worktag should end in ``AG``, ``CC``,
``GF``, ``GR``, or ``DE``. If you have any additional comments for our Treasurer, be sure to provide them in the
`Comments` field then hit `Pay`.

Once our Treasurer receives your request, they will create an Internal Service Delivery (ISD) in Workday. Be sure to
approve the ISD when you receive it.


Pay by cash or check
--------------------

To pay with cash or check, contact our Treasurer by emailing `lnl-t@wpi.edu <mailto:lnl-t@wpi.edu>`_.
