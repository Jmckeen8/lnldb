========================================
Checking into an Office or Storage Space
========================================

.. warning::
    All LNL Members are expected to be checking in and out of LNL's spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to do
    so could result in disciplinary action. For more information visit https://lnl.wpi.edu/safety.

When going into any of the LNL spaces on campus, you will need to check in and out. This includes all our closets and
office spaces.

Overview
--------

Watch the following video for a brief overview of how to reserve a space and check in and out upon arrival.

        <iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xKbnzHTOGFA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

Checking In
-----------

Upon entering any of our spaces, you will find a sign with a QR code on the door. Scan the first QR code on the sign.
If you cannot scan the QR code, or cannot access the QR code for any reason, you can visit
`lnl.wpi.edu/checkin <https://lnl.wpi.edu/checkin>`_ and click the first `Select` button under the space you are
accessing. Now be sure to list any other people accessing the space with you (only one person needs to do this) and
specify the reason for your visit. Finally, click or tap the `Submit` button and you're done!

Checking Out
------------

Checking out is very similar to checking into a space. Either scan the second QR code or visit
`lnl.wpi.edu/checkin <https://lnl.wpi.edu/checkin>`_ again and click the second `Select` button under the space you are
leaving. You can once again add anyone else checking out with you, click `Submit`, and you are done.
