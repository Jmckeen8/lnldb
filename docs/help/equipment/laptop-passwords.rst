Access Laptop Passwords
=======================

LNL devices are password-protected for security. As an active LNL member, you have access to these passwords through the
LNLDB and can use them to access the laptops as necessary at LNL functions.


Which password do I need?
-------------------------

In most circumstances all you need is the regular password to the laptop. The regular password will let you log into the
laptop, change most settings, and use most applications. LNL's MacBooks are also setup with a managed app store where
you can install applications typically used by LNL all without the administrator password. For more details please
review :doc:`Installing Software on the MacBooks <mdm-software>`.

If you ever need an administrator password you may access it as described below, however please ensure that you have
exhausted all other options first. A log is kept of who accesses the administrator password and when and can be viewed
at any time by members of the executive board. The MacBooks may also be reimaged at any time, with or without notice,
whenever the administrator password has been used.

.. caution::
    Only active members will have access to the administrator password. This password should rarely ever be used. The
    MacBooks are set up in such a way that you shouldn't ever really need it. Your use of the password will be logged.

.. tip::
    The administrator password will change from time to time, while the regular password remains the same. As such, you
    do not need to login to check the regular password each time you would like to use a laptop!


Accessing Passwords
-------------------

If you are an active or alumni LNL member, accessing the laptop passwords is pretty straightforward:

1. Log into the `LNLDB <https://lnl.wpi.edu/db>`_
2. In the menu at the top of the page, select `Equipment` > `Laptops`
3. Select `View Password` for the device you wish to view the password for

.. tip::
    All the laptops LNL owns are labeled both on the laptop itself and on the associated road case. Make sure you select
    the password that corresponds to the device you are using.
