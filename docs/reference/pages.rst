Pages
=====

This module makes it possible to quickly create new webpages using the Django admin site. You can create custom pages
which utilize our static site's stylesheets as well as simple onboarding screens which can be displayed immediately
after a user logs in. This is also where you'll find the source code for our main onboarding processes for new members.
